Load implementation:

model = getModel("trained_model")
loss, acc = model.evaluate(testing_data, testing_labels, verbose=2)
print('Restored model, accuracy: {:5.2f}%'.format(100 * acc))

This matches the provided load implementation, but still works with dropout layers and the compile-fit model implementation
